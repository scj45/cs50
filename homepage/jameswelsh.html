            UK-based skincare influencer has spent the last 7 years immersed in the world of beauty and educating the masses when it comes to what you should and shouldn't put on your face. A big advocate of korean beauty, James ruthlessly reviews the most up-to-date skincare products and trends, so that his viewers can make the most informed purchasing choices. He often consults and collaborates with cosmetic chemists and aestheticians so that his information is accurate. He is always fully transparent about his partnerships, and isn't afraid to call brands out on bad practices!
